# W3Pi_Analysis

This repository contains the main code which I developed during my work at Cern for my master thesis.

- hls folder: gen4.cc is the code to generate the output of the correlator layer, emulating the puppi candidates of the W3pi signal events.
    - to create the hls project you need the run_hls_gen4.tcl file
    - proj_gen4: contains all the files generated by vitis
      - syn: files generated after run the synthesis on vitis, to include in the top file for the bitfile
- gen4: to exctract the bitfile from the hls code, you need some infrastructure such as the top file
